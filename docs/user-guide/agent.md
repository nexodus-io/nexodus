# Deploying the Nexodus Agent

## Deploying on a Node

The following sections contain general instructions to deploy the Nexodus agent on any node. The minimum requirement is that the node runs Linux, Darwin, or Windows-based Operating systems.

### Installing the Agent

#### Fedora, CentOS Stream - RPM

Supported versions:

- Fedora 38 (x86_64, aarch64)
- CentOS Stream 9 (x86_64, aarch64)

A Fedora [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/russellb/nexodus/) is updated with new rpms after each new commit to the `main` branch that passes CI. The rpm will include `nexctl`, `nexd`, and integration with systemd.

You can add this repository to your Fedora host with the following command:

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable russellb/nexodus
```

Then you should be able to install Nexodus with:

```sh
sudo dnf install nexodus
```

You can start `nexd` as a systemd service. First, edit `/etc/sysconfig/nexodus` to reflect the URL of the Nexodus service or add any additional command line arguments to `nexd`. Then, start the agent with the following command:

```sh
sudo systemctl start nexodus
```

If you would like `nexd` to run automatically on boot, run this command as well:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable nexodus
```

### Mac - Brew

For Mac, you can install the Nexodus Agent via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew tap nexodus-io/nexodus
brew install nexodus
```

To start the `nexd` agent and also have it start automatically on boot, run:

```sh
sudo brew services start nexodus
```

To stop the `nexd` agent, run:

```sh
sudo brew services stop nexodus
```

### Binary Downloads

You can download the latest release package for your OS and architecture. Each release includes a `nexd` binary and a `nexctl` binary.

- [Linux x86-64](https://nexodus-io.s3.amazonaws.com/qa/nexodus-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux arm64](https://nexodus-io.s3.amazonaws.com/qa/nexodus-linux-arm64.tar.gz)
- [Linux arm](https://nexodus-io.s3.amazonaws.com/qa/nexodus-linux-arm.tar.gz)
- [Mac x86-64](https://nexodus-io.s3.amazonaws.com/qa/nexodus-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Mac arm64 (M1, M2)](https://nexodus-io.s3.amazonaws.com/qa/nexodus-darwin-arm64.tar.gz)
- [Windows x86-64](https://nexodus-io.s3.amazonaws.com/qa/nexodus-windows-amd64.zip)

Extract and install the binaries. For example, on Linux x86-64:

```sh
tar -xzf nexodus-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd nexodus-linux-amd64
sudo install -m 755 nexd nexctl /usr/local/bin
sudo install -m 644 bash_autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/nexd
sudo install -m 644 bash_autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/nexctl
```

Proceed by starting `nexd` manually:

```sh
sudo nexd https://try.nexodus.io
```

### Interactive Enrollment

If the agent can successfully reach the Service API, it will provide a one-time code to provide to the service web UI to complete enrollment of this node into a Nexodus organization. If you ran `nexd` manually, you will see a message like the following in your terminal:

```sh
Your device must be registered with Nexodus.
Your one-time code is: LTCV-OFFS
Please open the following URL in your browser to sign in:
https://auth.try.nexodus.127.0.0.1.nip.io/realms/nexodus/device?user_code=LTCV-OFFS
```

If the agent was started using systemd on Linux or launchd on Mac, you will find the same thing in the service logs. You can also retrieve this status information using `nexctl`.

```sh
$ sudo nexctl nexd status
Status: WaitingForAuth
Your device must be registered with Nexodus.
Your one-time code is: LTCV-OFFS
Please open the following URL in your browser to sign in:
https://auth.try.nexodus.127.0.0.1.nip.io/realms/nexodus/device?user_code=LTCV-OFFS
```

Once enrollment is completed in the web UI, the agent will show progress.

```text
Authentication succeeded.
...
INFO[0570] Peer setup complete
```

### User / Password Enrollment

If you would like to use a username and password to enroll your node, you can do so by passing the `--username` and `--password` flags to `nexd`. For example:

```sh
sudo nexd --username user --password pw https://try.nexodus.io
```

For [try.nexodus.io](https://try.nexodus.io), you may set a password for your account by visiting the [Keycloak user management UI](https://auth.try.nexodus.io/realms/nexodus/account/#/security/signingin).

### Multiple Organizations

When `nexd` starts, it will check to see which organizations it has access to. If no organization is specified, it will connect to the user's default organization. The default is the organization that has the same name as the user.

If `nexd` sees that it has access to multiple organizations, it will require you to specify which one to connect to. You can do this by passing the `--organization-id` flag to `nexd`. For example:

```sh
sudo nexd --organization-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 https://try.nexodus.io
```

### Verifying Agent Setup

Once the Agent has been started successfully, you should see a wireguard interface with an IPv4 and IPv6 address assigned. For example, on Linux:

```sh
$ ip address show wg0
1443: wg0: <POINTOPOINT,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1420 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/none
    inet 100.100.0.1/32 scope global wg0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 200::1/64 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

### Verifying Organization Connectivity

Once more than one node has enrolled in the same Nexodus organization, you will see additional routes populated for reaching other nodes' endpoints in the same organization. For example, we have just added a second node to this organization. The new node's address in the Nexodus organization is `100.100.0.2` and `200::2`. On Linux, we can check the routing table and see:

```sh
$ ip route
...
100.100.0.2 dev wg0 scope link

$ ip -6 route
200::2 dev wg0 metric 1024 pref medium
200::/64 dev wg0 proto kernel metric 256 pref medium
```

You should now be able to reach that node over the wireguard tunnel.

```sh
$ ping 100.100.0.2
PING 100.100.0.2 (100.100.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 100.100.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.63 ms

$ ping -6 200::2
PING 200::2(200::2) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 200::2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.16 ms
```

You can explore the web UI by visiting the URL of the host you added in your `/etc/hosts` file. For example, `https://try.nexodus.127.0.0.1.nip.io/`.

### Cleanup Agent From Node

If you want to remove the node from the network, and want to clean up all the configuration done on the node. Fire away following commands:

Ctrl + c (cmd+c) the agent process. and remove the wireguard interface and relevant configuration files.
*Linux:*

```shell
sudo ip link del wg0
```

*OSX/Windows:*

Since the wireguard agents are userspace in both Windows and Darwin, the tunnel interface is removed when the agent process exits.

## Deploying on Kubernetes-managed Nodes

Instructions mentioned in [Deploying on a Node](#deploying-on-a-node) can be used here to deploy the Nexodus agent on Kubernetes-managed nodes. However, deploying the agent across all the nodes in a sizable Kubernetes cluster can be a challenging task. The following section provides instructions to deploy Kubernetes style manifest to automate the deployment process.

### Setup the configuration

Agent deployment in Kubernetes requires a few initial configuration details to successfully deploy the agent and onboard the node. This configuration is provided through `kustomization.yaml`. Make a copy of the sample [`kustomization.yaml.sample`](https://github.com/nexodus-io/nexodus/blob/main/deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml.sample) and rename it to `kustomization.yaml`.

Fetch the CA cert from the Kubernetes cluster that is running the Nexodus Service, and set the return cert string to `cert` literal of `secretGenerator` in `kustomization.yaml`.

```sh
kubectl get secret -n nexodus nexodus-ca-key-pair -o json | jq -r '.data."ca.crt"'
```

Update the `<nexodus_SERVICE_IP>` with the IP address where the Nexodus Service is reachable. If you are running the Nexodus stack in Kind cluster on your local machine, set it to the public IP of the machine.

**Note**
Current username and password are default configuration for the development environment, which is very likely to change in near future.

You can refer to [kustomization.yaml.sample](https://github.com/nexodus-io/nexodus/blob/main/deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml.sample) for an example manifest.

If you have set up your Nexodus stack with a non-default configuration, please copy the [sample](./../deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/sample/) directory and update the sample file accordingly to create a new overlay for your setup and deploy it.

### Deploying the Agent in the Kind Dev Environment

If you're using the kind-based development environment, you can deploy the agent to each node in that cluster using this command:

```sh
make deploy-nexodus-agent
```

Then you may skip down to the [Verify the Deployment](#verify-the-deployment) section.

Otherwise, if you are working with another cluster, continue to the next section.

### Deploying the Nexodus Agent Manifest

Once the configuration is set up, you can deploy Nexodus's manifest files.

```sh
kubectl apply -k ./deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/dev
```

It will deploy a DaemonSet in the newly created `Nexodus` namespace. DaemonSet deploys a Pod that runs a privileged container that does all the required configuration on the local node. It also starts the agent and onboard the device automatically using the non-interactive access token-based onboarding.

**Note**
If your Kubernetes cluster enforces security context to deny privileged container deployment, you need to make sure that the security policy is added to the service account `nexodus` (created for the agent deployment) to allow the deployment.

### Controlling the Agent Deployment

By default, Nexodus agent is deployed using DaemonSet, so Kubernetes will deploy Nexodus agent pod on each worker node. This might not be the ideal strategy for onboarding Kubernetes worker nodes for many reasons. You can control the Nexodus agent deployment by configuring the `nodeAffinity` in the [node_selector.yaml](https://github.com/nexodus-io/nexodus/blob/main/deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/dev/node_selector.yaml).

The default behavior is set to deploy Nexodus pod on any node that is running Linux Operating System and is tagged with `app.kubernetes.io/nexodus=`. With this deployment strategy, once you apply the Nexodus manifest, Kubernetes won't deploy Nexodus pod on any worker node. To deploy the Nexodus pod on any worker node, tag that node with `app.kubernetes.io/nexodus=` label.

```sh
kubectl label nodes <NODE_NAME> app.kubernetes.io/nexodus=
```

If you want to remove the deployment from that node, just remove the label.

```sh
kubectl label nodes <NODE_NAME> app.kubernetes.io/nexodus-
```

If you want to change the deployment strategy for Nexodus pod, please copy the [sample](./../deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/sample/) directory to create a new overlay, and configure the  [node_selector.yaml.sample](https://github.com/nexodus-io/nexodus/blob/main/deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/dev/node_selector.yaml) file as per your requirements. After making the required changes rename the file to `node_selector.yaml` and deploy it.

Currently, the sample file provides two strategies to control the deployment, but feel free to change it based on your requirements.

1 ) Deploy Nexodus pod on any node that is tagged with `app.kubernetes.io/nexodus=`

```yaml
  - key: app.kubernetes.io/nexodus
    operator: Exists
```

2 ) Deploy Nexodus pod on specific node/s in the Kubernetes cluster. Uncomment the following lines in `node_selector.yaml.sample` and add the list of the nodes.

```yaml
# Deploy Nexodus client on  specific nodes
#              - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
#                operator: In
#                values:
#                - <NODE_1>
#                - <NODE_2>
```

### Verify the deployment

Check that nexodus pod is running on the nodes

```sh
kubectl get pods -n nexodus -o wide
```

Login to one of the nodes, and you should see a wireguard interface with an address assigned. For example, on Linux:

```sh
$ ip address show wg0
1448: wg0: <POINTOPOINT,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1420 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/none
    inet 100.100.0.1/32 scope global wg0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 200::1/64 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

### Cleanup Agent Pod From Node

Removing the Nexodus manifest will remove the Nexodus pod and clean up WireGuard configuration from the node as well.

```sh
kubectl delete -k ./deploy/nexodus-client/overlays/dev
```
